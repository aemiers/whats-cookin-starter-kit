# Recipe Researcher

Through the application, recipes can be favorited, added to a to-cook queue, and the user knows exactly which ingredients they need to purchase.

Once the user has found a recipe they are interested in, they view the recipe in greater detail, expanding the recipe, its ingredients, and the cooking instructions.

From there, the user can favorite, unfavorite, or add the recipe to their "Queue".

Recipe Researcher is unique from other applications because of its ability to compare the ingredients in a user's pantry to those listed in the recipe. The user will be informed whether or not they have the items needed to cook the recipe they are interested in. If all of the items are accounted for, the user will see a green check.

If there are some ingredients missing from the user's pantry that is needed to make the recipe, red x's will appear.
